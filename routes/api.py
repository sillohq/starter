"""API routes.

Handlers take ``(request, response)`` and return the response. Path parameters
are injected as keyword arguments, and the converter in the path — ``{id:int}``
— determines the type that arrives. Query, header, cookie and form values use
the markers from ``sillo``, which feed both validation and the OpenAPI schema
so the published contract cannot drift from the enforced one.
