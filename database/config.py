"""Tortoise configuration for migrations.

Migrations run outside the application, so they cannot ask the running app for
its database settings. ``TORTOISE_ORM`` is read from here instead, and the URL
comes from the environment, so the application and the migration tooling cannot
drift apart.

Sillo uses Tortoise's own migration engine (``tortoise.migrations``), which
tracks applied migrations in the ``tortoise_migrations`` table. There is no
aerich involved and no ``aerich.models`` entry to add.
