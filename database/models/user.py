"""The application's user model.

``sillo.users.UserBaseModel`` supplies the fields and behaviour authentication
depends on — email, username, hashed password, the active/staff/superuser
flags, and ``set_password``/``check_password``. Subclassing it here rather than
using ``sillo.users.User`` directly gives you a model you can add fields to.

Two constraints are worth knowing before you edit this file:

* Only the modules listed in ``model_modules`` (see ``app/bootstrap.py``) are
  registered with the ORM, and models are keyed by class name. Do not add
  ``sillo.users`` to that list — its built-in ``User`` would displace this one
  and your extra columns would silently stop being created.
* Tortoise does not call Django's ``contribute_to_class`` hook, so the manager
  is bound to this model explicitly at the bottom of the file.
